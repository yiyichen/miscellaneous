    "Interval $I(Y)$ is defined as $\\{\\eta: Y \\in A_{\\eta}\\}$. The notation means the set of $\\eta$ that contains $Y$ in their corresponding $A_{\\eta}$, a.k.a all the potential values of $\\theta$ estimates which have their intervals ($A_{\\eta}$) covering the observed $Y$\n",

    "1. $P_{\\theta}(Y \\in A_{\\theta}) \\geq 1 - \\alpha$. This means that with probability of $1 - \\alpha$ and greater, $Y$ will be included in $A_{\\theta}$ if $\\theta$ is the true parameter. This is true because that's how we construct $A$ to begin with\n",
    "2. Given 1, when $Y$ is indeed included in $A_{\\theta}$, $\\theta$ will be included in $I(Y)$. This is true by the definition of $I(Y)$, which includes all values of $\\eta$ (including $\\theta$) that contains $Y$ in their corresponding $A$  \n",
    "3. Since when 1 happens, 2 happens, the probability of $\\theta$ being included in $I(Y)$ is at least $1 - \\alpha$"
